# ReeZIP-Cracker

A very simple app that dictionary attacks .ZIP files. Made since I couldn't find a decent free alternative.

Makes use of Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll v1.9.1.8 from https://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/

The Releases folder has been intentionally kept at the moment for those who don't wish to compile their own, and just want to quickly download this.
